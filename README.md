# Week1-CodeChallenge
<h1>Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)</h1>
<p> This is a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A > 79</li>
<li>B - 60 to 79</li>
<li>C -  59 to 49</li>
<li>D - 40 to 49</li>
<li>E - less 40</li>
</ul>
<p>The code should also print out an errror message incase the user gives an incorrect input</p>

<h2>Set-Up Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Git clone from (https://github.com/Bashu-011/Week1-CodeChallenge.git)
 </li>
<li>cd into the cloned directory</li>
<li>Download the necessary dependancies</li>
<li>Work with the .js file</li>
</ul>

<h2>Executing the project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are in the Week1-CodeChallenge</li>
<li>Run node main.js</li>
</ul>

<h1>Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)</h1>
<p>This is a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.</p>
<p>The code is in the license.js file.</p>
<h2>Executing the file</h2>
<p>Ensure you are in the correct directory. Run the code using node license.js file. It will ask you for an input and you will give it one for the code to execute.</p>
